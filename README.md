### Genomics Data Warehouse and REST API Framework

## About

Centromere is a set of tools for developing scalable data warehouses and RESTful web services for processed genomic data.  It is designed to be modular and flexible, allowing you to mold it to fit your data model and business needs. Centromere is developed using the open-source, enterprise-grade SpringFramework, and supports integration with multiple database technologies.  You can use Centromere to create a new data warehouse from scratch, or bootstrap one or more existing databases, and make your data available via a customizable REST API.

Centromere aims to help solve some common problems inherent in monolithic bioinformatics app development:
- Fragmentation of data across large organizations.
- Inconsistent annotation.
- Horizontal and vertical scalability.
- Repetition of work in software development.

What Centromere is _**not**_:
- A LIMS system.
- A repository for raw genomic data.
- An analysis platform.
- An end-user GUI application.
